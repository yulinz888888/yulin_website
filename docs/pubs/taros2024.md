# IntelliMove: Enhancing Robotic Planning with Semantic Mapping  
**Fama Ngom, Huaxi Zhang (Yulin), Lei Zhang, Karen Godary-Dejean, Marianne Huchard**

Semantic navigation enables robots to understand their environments beyond basic geometry, allowing them to reason about objects, their functions, and their interrelationships. In semantic robotic navigation, creating accurate and semantically enriched maps is fundamental. Planning based on semantic maps not only enhances the robot's planning efficiency and computational speed but also makes the planning more meaningful, supporting a broader range of semantic tasks.
